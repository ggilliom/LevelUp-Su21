# LevelUp-Su21

To run the program, you need only run two things in the terminal:

(This assumes that you've installed Python.)

1) python3 sheetScrape.py
2) python3 sheetSearchGUI.py

(Also, there are a variety of packages that were imported to the program. If the program doesn't run, that means you need to install some/all of the packages that are included at the top of one or both of the python files listed above.)
